## Description
I started this sketch in 2019 practicing conditionals using [The coding train "Bouncing ball" tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIKRXl3wH8Y) as a guide. I modified the code so I could make the spheres bounce off of each other when touching and multiply the number of spheres. Feel free to use this code to create your own version and make sure to send me what you come up with at sofiaacostarascon@gmail.com
